Hi!

I just saw in my Github activity stream that you forked my fork of saml2aws.

While I'm flattered that anyone would ever want to reuse my code, it did surprise me that you forked this version of it!

My fork should have been deleted already.

It was for a PR that has been merged into the main saml2aws codebase.

https://github.com/Versent/saml2aws/pull/556

Just so you know...

Regards

Iain

PS I don't see an "Issues" button on your repo. This file is the only way I found to contact you through Github. I hope you don't mind.
